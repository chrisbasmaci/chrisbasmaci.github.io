        <p class="long-margin">I am a tech enthusiast with a very adaptive skillset and a creative mindset. Despite being creative I find it important to be rational and logical while taking on new projects. Even with my limited experience there is no problem/obstacle I find to be too difficult for me to overcome with my keen eye and problem solving skills. </p>

        <h3>Local internships</h3>
        <p class="light">Working at local workshops/p>
        <p class="justified">I've always had an interest in woodworking and other creative handywork, which is why during the summer of 2016 I started working next to a stair builder/craftsman. During this internship we went to houses under construction and finished building the stairs. </p>
        <p class="justified">Another internship I did at a local craftsman was at a felt workshop.  Here we would use the excess felt they had left from bigger felt pieces and put them together to create patchworks. We would also put together  felt scarfs, which we would  sell at our shop. </p>
            
        <h3>Sport history</h3>
        <p class="justified">Even though I wouldn't classify myself as a very energetic person, I've always loved doing sports. I started playing basketball during middle school because I was always very tall and talented. Even though I was pretty good at it and continued to play basketball on and off through the years I didnâ€™t enjoy it as much as other sports which lead me to concentrate on other sports. </p>
        <p class="justified">During middle school I also tried multiple sport types such as swimming, archery, fencing and taekwondo. Out of all these sports I ended up enjoying taekwondo the most, which piqued my interest in martial arts. </p>
        <p class="justified">After starting high school, I also started kickboxing. I've trained for about 3-4 years consistently and even got a license. I did also earn some belts, however after learning that there is a time period to be able to climb the ranks, I decided against to get more since I had no interest in becoming a professional.</p>
