        <h3>Hepsiburada Internship</h3>
        <p class="light">Working for our coffeeshop in grandbazaar in Turkey/Istanbul</p>
        <p class="justified">Before I even started with my University, I did a short term internship at the Hepsiburada storage house as one of the inventory sorters in order to understand how their operation functioned. After I started with my university, I decided to do an internship at their IT department to further improve my coding skills. During this internship I have greatly improved my object oriented programming and learned using design patterns to make my codes more adaptive, and readable.</p>
        
        <h3>Working at Grandbazaar</h3>
        <p class="light">IT internship at Hepsiburada (a turkish alternative to amazon)</p>
        <p class="justified">Every summer from 2017 to 2019, in order to support our family business I've worked at our coffeeshop in the Grandbazaar as a waiter. This experience has helped me improve my language- and communication skills.  </p>
        <p class="justified">After starting with university, I started using the new knowledge I've gained to propel our store. Since our store had a lot of unique items which were unsorted, my first initiative was to start documenting everything and create a database so that we can easily keep track of them. In order to achieve this I've digitalized all of the hand written stock information we had in forms of csv files. After that wrote a python script to create a local database with all of the information stored in the csv files.</p>
        <p class="justified">My next initiative was to modernize our shop menu while keeping the authentic and oriental aspects of our shop. I used some of the design patterns from the antique tiles we had in our storage and created vector images for us to use. With the new design elements and a modernized layout I put together a new menu from scratch.</p>
        <p class="justified">My final initiative for our store is to create a website for ecommerce. The skeleton of our site is almost finished, however it's still a work in progress.</p>
        
        <h3>Local internships</h3>
        <p class="light">Working at local workshops/p>
        <p class="justified">I've always had an interest in woodworking and other creative handywork, which is why during the summer of 2016 I started working next to a stair builder/craftsman. During this internship we went to houses under construction and finished building the stairs. </p>
        <p class="justified">Another internship I did at a local craftsman was at a felt workshop.  Here we would use the excess felt they had left from bigger felt pieces and put them together to create patchworks. We would also put together  felt scarfs, which we would  sell at our shop. </p>
            
        <h3>Sport history</h3>
        <p class="justified">Even though I wouldn't classify myself as a very energetic person, I've always loved doing sports. I started playing basketball during middle school because I was always very tall and talented. Even though I was pretty good at it and continued to play basketball on and off through the years I didnâ€™t enjoy it as much as other sports which lead me to concentrate on other sports. </p>
        <p class="justified">During middle school I also tried multiple sport types such as swimming, archery, fencing and taekwondo. Out of all these sports I ended up enjoying taekwondo the most, which piqued my interest in martial arts. </p>
        <p class="justified">After starting high school, I also started kickboxing. I've trained for about 3-4 years consistently and even got a license. I did also earn some belts, however after learning that there is a time period to be able to climb the ranks, I decided against to get more since I had no interest in becoming a professional.</p>
